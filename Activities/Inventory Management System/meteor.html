  <h3>The Story</h3>
<p>The Meteor represents the eternal essence of riding, the spirit of the cruise; with classic contours & timeless design cues, it is an easy thoroughbred cruiser, ready for the open highway and for meeting the challenges of urban commute with equal ease.</p>

  <h3>Cruising Through Time</h3>
<p>Growing up in the 1980s meant that the lasting image of a motorcycle for me was a cruiser of some sort. It’s not that I was a ‘cruiser guy’, it’s just that when you see lots of something, that becomes the main frame of reference, and desire in this case! Evolving from a diet of bicycles into my late teens, I was quite mesmerised by the idea of a quintessential American style cruiser - and the first one that I actually saw in the flesh and instantly fell in love with was the Royal Enfield Citybike.</p>
